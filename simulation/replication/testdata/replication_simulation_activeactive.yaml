# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive.yml
# Tests that active-active allows workflows to be created in multiple clusters
