# TODO(active-active): validating cron is not as trivial as checking completion status.
# It keeps creating new runs every minute.
# Add a custom validation for cron workflows:
# - Let it run for 3 minutes
# - List the workflows by id
# - Validate first 2 continued as new and last one is running (waiting for initial decision task)
