# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_same_wfid_signalwithstart
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_same_wfid_signalwithstart.yml
# When a domain is configured as active-active
# And the same workflow ID is used to SignalWithStart in multiple clusters
# Then the 'earlier' workflow should be terminated
# And the 'later' workflow should complete
