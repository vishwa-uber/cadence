# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activepassive_to_activeactive
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activepassive_to_activeactive.yml
# Validates behaviour of workflows in a domain converted from active-passive to active-active
# When a domain is migrated from active-passive to active-active
# It should run new workflows in region sticky mode
