# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_signalwithstart_terminateifrunning
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_signalwithstart_terminateifrunning.yml
# Tests that active-active allows workflows to be created in multiple clusters with terminate if running policy.
# If the existing workflow is active in the same cluster with the new workflow, the existing workflow should be terminated.
# If the existing workflow is active in a different cluster with the same active cluster selection policy, the start workflow should fail.
